 * The rest of the headers are straight blocks, safe to enforce today:
 *   - HSTS: only meaningful on HTTPS (no-op on http://localhost).
 *   - X-Content-Type-Options / X-Frame-Options / Referrer-Policy:
 *     baseline OWASP hardening, no behavioural cost.

 *     deny them. A supply-chain compromise or a forgotten plugin

  /**
   * Cache-Control policy.
   *
   * Why this exists:
   *   Hostinger's CDN was applying `s-maxage=31536000` (1 year) to
   *   prerendered HTML pages by default. When a new deploy shipped
   *   fresh Turbopack chunk hashes, the edge kept serving year-old
   *   HTML referencing chunk filenames that no longer existed on
   *   disk — result: HTML 200, every /_next/static/*.js and .css
   *   came back 404, the page rendered unstyled. Private/incognito
   *   did nothing because the cache is server-side.
   *
   * Strategy:
   *   - /_next/static/* — leave to Next. Turbopack dev chunks can go
   *     stale if we force immutable caching here; Next already emits
   *     the correct production headers for hashed assets.
   *   - /api/*          — no-store. API responses are per-user and
   *     must never be shared across requests at the edge.
   *   - Everything else — private/no-store. Authentication redirects
   *     and user-specific HTML must never be cached by Hostinger's CDN.
   *
   * Security headers are appended via a separate catch-all rule
   * below — Next.js merges headers from every matching rule, so
   * they apply to every response regardless of which cache rule
   * matched.
